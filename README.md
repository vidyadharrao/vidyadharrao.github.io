- 👋 Namaste! My research interests span in the topics of computer science, algorithms and statistics. More specifically, on mathematical & computational problems in Machine Learning, Optimization & Computer Vision.
- 👀  I'm keen to collaborate with domain expert(s) to solve problems with a focus on algorithms that learn from complex & dynamic, (un)structured & uncertain, incomplete & multi-source data.
