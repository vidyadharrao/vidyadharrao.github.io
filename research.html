            <div class="pubd"><blockquote>
Typical retrieval systems have three requirements: a) Accurate retrieval i.e., the method should have high precision, b) Diverse retrieval, i.e., the obtained set of points should be diverse, c) Retrieval time should be small. However, most of the existing methods address only one or two of the above mentioned requirements. In this work, we present a method based on randomized locality sensitive hashing which tries to address all of the above requirements simultaneously. While earlier hashing approaches considered approximate retrieval to be acceptable only for the sake of efficiency, we argue that one can further exploit approximate retrieval to provide impressive trade-offs between accuracy and diversity. We extend our method to the problem of multi-label prediction, where the goal is to output a diverse and accurate set of labels for a given document in real-time. Moreover, we introduce a new notion to simultaneously evaluate a method's performance for both the precision and diversity measures. Finally, we present empirical results on several different retrieval tasks and show that our method retrieves diverse and accurate images/labels while ensuring 100x-speed-up over the existing diverse retrieval approaches.

            <div class="pubd"><blockquote>
Instance retrieval(IR) is the problem of retrieving specific instances of a particular object, like a monument, from a collection
of images. Currently, the most popular methods for IR use Bag of words (BoW) features for
retrieval. However, a prominent problem for IR remains the tendency of BoW based methods to
retrieve near-identical images as most relevant results. We define diversity in IR as variation of
physical properties among most relevant retrieved results for a query image. To achieve this, we
propose both an ITML algorithm that re-fashions the BoW feature space into one that appreciates 
diversity better, and a measure to evaluate diversity in retrieval results for IR applications.
Although retrieving visually similar images is arguably the most obvious application where metric 
distance learning plays an important role, we showed its application to diverse IR where a
good distance metric is essential in obtaining competitive performances.

In this work, the focus is on what is right amount of labeled data needed to
learn a the structure of data. While the supervised learning requires labeled data, an interesting question
is: what can one learn from data that does not provide any clue on a function that is to be approximated?
In practice semi-supervised learning make some type of assumptions on how the labels behave with respect
to the structure of the unlabeled data. In this context, the clustering performance can be improved in two
ways: a) learn a distance metric from randomly chosen labels or b) actively select informative labels using
a generic distance measure like Euclidean norm. However, it is clear that when more informative labels
are under the learned metric, the more likely they are to improve the quality of clusters. We proposed a
greedy approach to simultaneously find out informative labels and learn metrics to improve the clustering
performance.

The fundamental problem in cryptography is secure tranmission of a message between two legitimate users (the sender Alice
and the receiver Bob) over an insecure communication channel such that an enemy (Eve) with
access to the channel is unable to get useful information about the message being sent. We review
some of the most famous results related to this problem from an information theoretic security

has a better channel than the legitimate users, it is possible to have strictly positive secrecy

In this work, we implemented several algorithms which are aimed at understanding the two fundamental questions. The first is about using vision as a source of geometry information: given one or more images of a scene taken by a camera with known or unknown parameters, how much can we tell about the structure of the environment pictured in those images? The primary focus is on establishing a camera view relationship between two images from detected and matched point correspondences from input images, without user input or calibration. This requires us to first find interesting points using the feature detectors, obtain point correspondences, and finally estimate the fundamental matrix using RANSAC Algorithm. The second is all about vision as a source of semantic information: can we recognize the objects, people, or activities pictured in the images? Here, we implemented some basic techniques used in computer vision like filtering, edge detection, face detection and person detection.

We look at a fundamental question:
Can two parties owning confidential databases wish to run a machine learning algorithm on
their databases, without revealing any unnecessary information? In particular, we started with
a simple collaborative framework of email service providers with the goal to design an effective
anti-spam fliter. Since emails contain confidential information, any collaborative anti-spam 
approach has to guarantee strong privacy protection to the participating entities. However, training
a classifier is a complex task due to the computations involved as well as the communication over-head 
in the distributed setting. One way to move forward in this direction is to design efficient
distributed protocol with low communcation complexity. It is clear that any reasonable solution
must have the individual parties to do the majority of the computation independently. Using
this remark, we designed a private SVM training approach for a collaborative anti-spam filter.

With the amount of Video data growing rapidly on the net, to handle semantic reasoning capability one
has to resort to ontology of events. We attempted to make a hyper-video standard to allow navigation 
within the video by annotating episodes that give a visualization of the game, Cricket.
An episode is a sub-event that is defined on a linear time and has a start point and an end point.
The episodes are described based on the ontology of the events in cricket. Now, each episode
describes an event that has happened at some level of granularity in the game Cricket. This gives
a gist of the happenings in the video at regular intervals. We demonstrate that this ontology
specific marking of episodes in a cricket video is useful for content based video indexing.

Verb Frames are building blocks of linguistic computational models that play a major role in interpreting the sentence meaning. We attemptted to
cluster arguments of monosemous verb for Hindi Language using EM Clustering Algorithm. We
used the linguistic cues such as derivational morphological features to predict the number of
mandatory arguments the verb would take in a language. We demonstrate that the clusters give
only an estimate of the number of arguments to the verb and do not specify the type of relation
the verb holds with a particular cluster. In order to evaluate the relations we need to verify
whether similar arguments are falling into the same cluster. These methods give frequency of
usage and are helpful for unlabelled dependency parsing.
